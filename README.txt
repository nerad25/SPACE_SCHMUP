# SPACE_SCHMUP

An addition we made to the game was adding the potential for future blaster/shield power-ups, though we
did not get this functional (the enums/dictionaries exist but are buggy and thus commented out/unused). 
We did change the Enemy_1 movement to that of a sine wave according to the book's Chapter 31 tutorial. 
If the scrolling starfield background is hard to see, it could be the computer's brightness, as Hayley
had that issue on her computer--it looked more like the stars were flickering. Enemy projectiles also
disappeared for some unknown reason that was unable to be fixed, but physical impact with enemies does 
still deal damage to the player.
